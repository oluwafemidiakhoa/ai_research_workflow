AI Research Workflow Overview
AI Research Workflow is a Python-based application designed to orchestrate an AI-driven research process. It leverages multiple AI agents to perform specialized tasks, generate hypotheses, and manage the research workflow with both automated and human oversight. This modular and scalable system ensures efficient research execution, robust error handling, and continuous improvement through feedback mechanisms.

Features
Modular Design: Organized into agents, managers, and utilities for maintainability and scalability.
AI Agents: Specialized agents (e.g., Immunology AI, Bioinformatics AI, ML AI, Hypothesis Generator) perform distinct research tasks.
Human Oversight: The HumanResearcher class ensures critical issues are addressed promptly.
Logging Mechanism: Comprehensive logging captures all events, errors, and actions.
Feedback Loop: Continuous improvement through feedback provided by the PrincipalInvestigator.
Error Handling: Robust mechanisms handle errors with retry strategies for recoverable issues.

Description of Key Components
agents/
ai_agent.py: Defines the AIAgent base class responsible for task execution, retries, and strategy adjustments based on feedback.
hypothesis_agent.py: Inherits from AIAgent and specializes in generating hypotheses using the OpenAI API.
managers/
principal_investigator.py: Manages AI agents, assigns tasks, reviews results, and provides feedback.
human_researcher.py: Oversees the research process, addressing critical issues requiring human intervention.
utils/
logger.py: Configures centralized and consistent logging across modules.
logs/
ai_research.log: Logs events, errors, task outcomes, and other significant actions.
reports/
AI_Research_Report.pdf: Example of a generated research report summarizing task outcomes, errors, and hypotheses.
Miscellaneous
main.py: Entry point of the application that orchestrates the research workflow.
requirements.txt: Lists required Python dependencies.
README.md: Provides an overview of the application, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
Prerequisites
Before setting up the AI Research Workflow, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.6 or higher: Download Python
Git: Download Git
OpenAI API Key: Sign up and obtain an API key.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_research_workflow.git
cd ai_research_workflow
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
On Windows:

cmd
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
On Unix or macOS:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure requirements.txt includes necessary packages, such as openai.

Set the OpenAI API Key
On Windows (Command Prompt):

cmd
Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
On Windows (PowerShell):

powershell
Copy code
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
On Unix or macOS:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
Usage
Running the Research Workflow
To start the research process:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Workflow Highlights:
Initialization:

Sets up logging.
Initializes AI agents with configurations.
Adds agents to the PrincipalInvestigator's team.
Task Execution:

Agents perform tasks, handle retries, and log outcomes.
Result Review:

The PrincipalInvestigator reviews results and provides feedback.
Hypothesis Generation:

The HypothesisGenerator generates a new hypothesis using the OpenAI API.
Human Oversight:

The HumanResearcher addresses critical issues.
Summary:

Outputs a summary of the research process and outcomes.
Viewing Logs
Logs are stored in logs/ai_research.log.

Using Command Prompt:

cmd
Copy code
type logs\ai_research.log
Using PowerShell:

powershell
Copy code
Get-Content logs\ai_research.log
Using Unix or macOS:

bash
Copy code
cat logs/ai_research.log
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
API Key Errors:

Verify the API key is set correctly.
Confirm the key’s validity on OpenAI’s platform.
Permissions Issues:

Ensure logs/ exists and has write permissions.
Run the application with sufficient privileges.
Missing Dependencies:

Verify all packages are installed:
bash
Copy code
pip list
Install missing packages individually:
bash
Copy code
pip install package-name
